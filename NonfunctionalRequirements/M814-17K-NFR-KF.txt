FV : 
I do not think this NFR will pass the quality gateway because of two reasons:

* The fit Criteria is very open ended - I would quantify it in more detail - something like 'at least one device with Windows, Android, iOS that was released in the last year'

* I am also not sure if testing a website on Different hardware devices is something that will work practically - Browsers and Operating systems provide enough of an abstraction from the actual hardware in my view.

Jennifer Day : From experience, it is not possible to be able to test on every toes of device, the scope is quite wide.  I think a handful of named devices / resolutions should be targeted.
