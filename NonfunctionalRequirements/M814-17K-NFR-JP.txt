Comments:

-FrancoisViljoen(TMA03 Q1c) - I think this NFR is very valid in terms of its intent to define browser compatibility.  One aspect that one should probably consider adding to the fit criteria is specifying the actual versions of the respective browsers that needs to be supported.  One could also quantify it by saying something like 'Whenever a version is released, it should support all versions of the listed browsers released in the last 3 years.  This will future-proof this NFR, so it can be used indefinitely.
-Jennifer Day : I feel that the testing should be done against version XYZ of each browser listed, as future browser changes could cause problems with the product moving forward, and it would be good to know which version of each was tested.
-Kevin Florish: Bit pedantic but can you also add Opera to the browser list as I think 3-4% still use this browser.
