REQ-ID: M814-17K-NFR-MARIOBARANZINI

Description: The product shall return the list of matching properties within 5 seconds.
Type: Non-functional, Type 12 Performance
Rationale: If the user finds the product slow and poorly reactive, he may be tempting to go onto a competing product.
Fit Criterion: Same as the description (The product shall return the list of matching properties within 5 seconds.)
Originator: Ayisha Jayakodi - Agent

Comments:

Jennifer Day : I think that the description should be moved to the fit criterion, and maybe a more generic description applied? Maybe something like "The product shall return a list of properties, matching the selected search criteria, promptly".
