REQ-ID: M814-17K-NFR-SP

Description: The product shall ensure that data relating to rental properties may only be entered/updated by authorised personnel.

Type: 15 - Security Requirements

Rationale: The integrity of the data supplied by the property owner must be guaranteed. Any corruption of this data could invalidate the contract between Landbnb and the property owner. 

Fit Criterion: Authenticated users with admin privileges may update rental property details; authenticated property owners may update rental property details for a property that they own; authenticated property owners may not update property details for a property that they do not own; unauthenticated users may not update any rental property details.

Originator: Ayisha Jayakodi

[David James] the data is supplied in the first place by the property owner but your fit criterion mentions that only admin users may update property rentals. Did you mean to exclude the owner from updating their own property details? Surely this will create an administrative burden on the staff, perhaps consider expanding "authenticated users" to include the property owner
