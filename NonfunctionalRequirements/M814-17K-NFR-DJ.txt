[Gary-Mathers] : Hi David, hope this helps, for fit criterion I find it hard to read an actual measurement, for example I could say the consent to delivery payable services will be availble 
for consenting to in under a minute, with maybe an assumption as to what you may have agreed on with your stakeholder, finding out what time frame is important to them for additional supporting materials.
Other than measuring of fit criterion the description, type, rationale all seem really good.
