[Gary-Mathers] : Hi David, hope this helps, for fit criterion I find it hard to read an actual measurement, for example I could say the consent to delivery payable services will be availble 
for consenting to in under a minute, with maybe an assumption as to what you may have agreed on with your stakeholder, finding out what time frame is important to them for additional supporting materials.
Other than measuring of fit criterion the description, type, rationale all seem really good.
[David James] Thank you Gary for the feedback. I agree with you that there is no specific measurable goal in the fit criterion, and in fact on further review I don't even think I would classify my initial submission as a non-functional requirement! I did not turn it into a performance requirement as suggested but I did add a measurable criterion that the accurate price should be displayed and confirmed before proceeding.
