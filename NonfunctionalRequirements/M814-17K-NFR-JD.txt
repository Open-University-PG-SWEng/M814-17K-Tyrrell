Comments:

-FrancoisViljoen(TMA03 Q1c) - The Fit Criterion is missing from this NFR.  I think it could be a reference to the Style Guide of the Company in terms of Branding - and the version thereof.
[JaroslavPetrovskij] The fit criterion is not consistent with the organisational structure of Landbnb, which does not have a marketing team or department, which could provide branding guidelines. I would suggest that the fit criterion is reworded along the lines of "The design and branding scheme formally agreed with the Landbnb representative shall be followed throughout the product."
