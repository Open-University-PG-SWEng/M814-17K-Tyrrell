REQ-ID: M814-17K-NFR-AB
Description: The product shall compare the owners desired price of the property to prices of Similar Properties in the same area in real time.
Type: 12 - Non-Functional, Performance
Rationale: So that while the details of the property are being filled in, the comparison can take place resulting in a quicker comparison.
Fit Criterion: The process of obtaining the results of the comparison has to be initiated at a maximum delay of 20 milliseconds
after the first detail/attribute of the property being filled in is complete. Similarly, as soon as there are more details/attributes
of the property being filled in, the completion of these should restart the process with a maximum delay of 25 milliseconds.
Similarly, new properties added by other owners that match Similar Properties criteria (documented in 14.4-Similar-Properties),
should restart the processes of comparison of properties that are currently being compared, with a maximum delay of 50 milliseconds.
Originator: Ayisha Jayakodi


Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.

[Fernando Magrina] - I think it'd be better if there were different criteria, it looks like there is only one criteria for everything. I'd add more specific targets for other processes as it (in theory) is part of a thread.
